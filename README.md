# Menqu

Mendjan Lab qPCR analysis script

# Install

Install the script

* `pip3 install git+https://github.com/syntonym/qpcr_analysis --user`

You need to enable python scripts once, if you have never done that. For python 3.9 you can do this with the following commands:

* `echo PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin >> ~/.bash_profile`
* `echo export PATH >> ~/.bash_profile`

For other python versions change the version number appropriatly.

You should now be able to execute the script via `menqu`.
